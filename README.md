## Description

The Maze Solver program is designed to read a maze from a file, represent it internally, and find a solution path from the starting point (A) to the ending point (B). An example .txt input file is provided in the repo
It utilizes Dept-First-search algorithm to explore possible paths through the maze until it finds a solution. New algorithms and improvements will be adden soon!


## Usage
Just clone the repo and execute the ```laberintos.py ``` file!
The required dependencies are:
1. Matplotlib
2. Numpy

The program will output whether a solution was found or not. If a solution is found, it will also display the solution path.
The graphical representation of the maze with the solution path will be displayed using Matplotlib.
